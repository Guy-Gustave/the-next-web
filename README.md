## Getting started
**For this project, we tried our best to recreate the next-web page. The main aim is to ensure the elements get placed and styled roughly the same way using responsive and media qwueries as the Next web page.**

We used the browserâ€™s developer tools to inspect the real next-web page to understand how elements are placed and styled on mobile or big screen.
We built our own page in a .html text file and opened it in our browser to check it out. We carried out the following steps:
  - First setup a github repository for the project.
  - Then create a .html file where all our HTML markup will go
  - Create a .css file where all our styling code will reside
  - Then open the Next-web page on https://thenextweb.com/ inspect its features with our browser's developer tools.
